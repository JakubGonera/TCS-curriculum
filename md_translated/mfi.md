## Extended Information

### Teaching Methods:

conventional lecture, multimedia presentation lecture, problem solving, subject tutorials

| Type of classes | Forms of credit | Course completion conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lecture | written exam | The exam will be in the form of a test. Admission to the exam test requires obtaining a positive credit. The final grade consists of 50% of points from the previously obtained credit and 50% of points from the exam test. GRADES FROM THE RESIT EXAM: The resit exam will be in the form of a test. All persons who did not pass the exam and also persons who did not get credit are admitted to the resit exam. The final grade after the resit exam consists of 40% of points previously earned for credit and 60% of points from the resit exam test. For persons who have not previously earned credit and who want to take the resit test, the final grade after the resit exam also becomes the credit grade. |
| tutorials | written credit | The credit grade consists of grades from tests 2 x 40p plus 20p for activity in tutorials. Grading scale: from 0 to 50 unsatisfactory; from 51 to 60 satisfactory; from 61 to 70 satisfactory+; from 71 to 80 good; from 81 to 90 good+; from 91 to 100 very good. |
