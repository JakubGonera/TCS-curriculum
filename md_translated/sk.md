## Extended information

### Teaching methods:

conventional lecture, laboratory classes

| Type of classes | Forms of credit | Course credit requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lecture | written exam | The student receives a final grade based on the sum of points awarded during exercises (0-60) and points obtained during the written exam (0-40). To pass the course, a positive grade from exercises and a minimum of 60 points in total are required. |
| laboratory classes | project, presentation | The student receives a final grade based on points awarded for active participation in exercises, credit projects, and systematically submitted solutions to homework and programming tasks (0-60 points). To pass, all projects and all mandatory tasks must be submitted, and a minimum of 40 points must be obtained. |
