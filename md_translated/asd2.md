## Extended information

### Teaching methods:

conventional lecture, laboratory classes

| Class type | Assessment forms | Course completion conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lecture | oral exam | Positive grade from the exam, covering the scope of ASD1 and ASD2 courses. Admission to the exam is conditional on a positive grade from the laboratory. The final grade is a weighted average of grades from ASD1 and ASD2 laboratories and the exam. |
| laboratory classes | credit | Laboratory completion based on assessment programs, homework assignments and tests. |
