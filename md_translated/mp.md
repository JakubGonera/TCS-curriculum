| 1. | 1. Computational complexity of algorithms – definition, notation, comparison of complexity functions. The concept of an abstract data type (ADT). Basic data structures: list, stack, queue, priority queue, dictionary; array, pointer, cursor implementation. Examples: binary search, topological sorting, memory management.    2. Tree structures: trees, binary trees, representations, elementary and advanced traversal algorithms, binary search tree.    3. Amortized complexity, dynamic arrays, hashing (basics).    4. Graphs: representation, BFS and DFS traversal, connected components, cycles, topological sorting with DFS, Euler cycle.    5. Recursion, conversion to iteration, examples: DFS with stack, backtracking.    6. Divide and conquer method, fast multiplication, merge sort, master theorem (simplified version).    7. Quicksort, variants (Hoare, Lomuto), non-recursive version.    8. Binary heap, heapsort, order statistics, counting tree.    9. Radix sort, lower bound on sorting complexity.    10. Dynamic programming – introduction.    11. Greedy algorithms – introduction. | W1,   W2,   W3,   U1,   U2,   U3,   U4,   U5,   K1 |
