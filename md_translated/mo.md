## Learning Outcomes for the Course

| Code | Effects in terms of | Field-specific learning outcomes | Verification methods |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Knowledge – The student knows and understands: | | | |
| W1 | what a formal language is and the basic facts about formal languages, | IAN\_K1\_W02 | written exam, graded credit |
| W2 | the basic tools: minimization of finite automata, mutual simulations of equivalent models, pumping lemmas, diagonal method | IAN\_K1\_W11 | written exam, graded credit |
| W3 | the concept of undecidability and basic computational complexity classes | IAN\_K1\_W02,   IAN\_K1\_W11 | written exam, graded credit |
| Skills – The student can: | | | |
| U1 | define a model describing a formal language and place the class of languages described by the defined model in the language hierarchy | IAN\_K1\_U01,   IAN\_K1\_U04,   IAN\_K1\_U11,   IAN\_K1\_U17,   IAN\_K1\_U21 | written exam, graded credit |
| U2 | select an appropriate model for the problem being solved | IAN\_K1\_U01,   IAN\_K1\_U04,   IAN\_K1\_U11,   IAN\_K1\_U17,   IAN\_K1\_U21 | written exam, graded credit |
| U3 | construct finite automata, context-free grammars, and Turing machines | IAN\_K1\_U09 | written exam, graded credit |
| Social competences – The student is ready to: | | | |
| K1 | prove theorems in computability theory; understand the profound implications of computability theory for broadly defined science and philosophy, e.g., knows and understands Church's thesis | IAN\_K1\_K01 | written exam, graded credit |
