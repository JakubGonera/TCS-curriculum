## Extended information

This course will be run as a research seminar with
several talks in the first two weeks followed by students
presenting their research. The talks will be based on previous
research presentations delivered over the last 5 years in various venues by me and my
collaborators.  In short, at the beginning I will cover information
theory starting with some philosophical discussion on "what is information"
and then moving to analytic information theory.
Then we discuss structural and temporal information and finally
connect analytic information theory and analytic learning theory.
In the next week, together with my postdoc we present elements of machine learning
and AI. We focus on online learning in the first four lectures with the last
on large language models of AI.

At the end  of the course (November 4-8) students will be asked to
give presentations on their favorite research topics.
The grade will be based on participations and the final presentations.

This will be a join seminar with Center for Science of Information (CSoI)

The talks will be given in English and will be recorded.

1. Organizational Meeting
