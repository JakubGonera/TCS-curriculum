| 1. | "Paradigms of Programming Languages" is a seminar dedicated to programming language design and implementation.    Students with a stronger theoretical inclination are invited to independently tackle the latest scientific results in this field (type systems, program correctness proofs, optimization, parallelization, etc.). For those interested in the practical side of the topic, we propose participation in an IT project related to programming language design and compiler implementation. | W1,   U1,   U2,   K1 |
