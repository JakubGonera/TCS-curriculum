## Extended information

### Teaching methods:

multimedia lecture, discussion, problem solving, laboratory classes

| Type of classes | Forms of credit | Course credit requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lecture | written exam | The student receives a final grade for the course based on points awarded during classes and points obtained during the written exam. The condition for receiving a positive final grade is obtaining class credit and accumulating a total of at least 60% of points. |
| laboratory classes | graded credit, programming tasks, test | The student receives a final grade for classes based on points awarded for systematically submitted programming tasks (mandatory and additional) and points obtained on the test. The condition for receiving class credit is submitting at least 70% of programming tasks, including all mandatory tasks, and accumulating a total of 60% of points. |
